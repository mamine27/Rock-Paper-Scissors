                <P>Welcome to the Rock-Paper-Scissors game, where epic hand-gesture battles await! Okay, maybe epic is a stretch, but if you’ve ever wanted to outwit a computer at the age-old game of randomness, you're in the right place. This project is more about showing off my code than world domination, but hey, why not give it a spin? Play a few rounds, laugh at the absurdity, and remember — no one expects you to become a rock-paper-scissors champion here... except maybe the computer.</P>
